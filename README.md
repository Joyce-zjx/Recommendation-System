# Recommendation-System
Personalized recommendation systems improve customer
satisfaction. It is significant to offer a simple feature
that enables users to set their preferences list in order to
increase the relevance of their recommendations. Based on the
situation that many platforms do not provide this feature on their
homepage for users, we propose a new recommendation system
that personalizes customersâ€™ recommendation lists based on their
expressed interests and preferences, by using Ticketmaster API
as an example, ultimately enhancing their browsing experience.
